# DevSecOps Pipeline - Natural Fit

A DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline project developed by **Hina Atif** for **DeployLynx.com** as part of a professional project-based assignment. This project demonstrates a full DevSecOps workflow using **Node.js**, **Express**, **Docker**, **GitHub Actions**, and **Trivy security scanning**.

---

## 📝 Project Overview

**Objective:** Build and secure a Node.js application with a production-ready CI/CD pipeline, incorporating automated builds, dependency scanning, and containerization.

**Tech Stack & Tools Used:**

- **Node.js 18 (Alpine)** – Lightweight, secure Node.js environment
- **Express** – Robust web server framework
- **Docker** – Containerization of the application
- **GitHub Actions** – CI/CD workflow automation
- **Trivy** – Container image vulnerability scanning
- **Vercel** – Deployment for the live production environment

🔒 DevSecOps Implementation
Security Middleware (Helmet)
We use Helmet.js to secure Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.

JavaScript
const helmet = require('helmet');
app.use(helmet());

Repository Management & Scanning
Clean Repo: Sensitive files like .env and bulky folders like node_modules are strictly ignored.

Vulnerability Scanning: Trivy scans every Docker build automatically within the GitHub Actions pipeline to catch security flaws before deployment.

---

Dockerfile Highlights
Base Image: Uses node:18-alpine for a reduced attack surface.

Principle of Least Privilege: Copies only necessary package files before source code to optimize build caching.
